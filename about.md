Josiah Wolf Oberholtzer is a composer and researcher, born in Boston in 1984.

His research interests range over live electronics, algorithmic composition,
music-informatics and audio analysis.



He also works as a sound designer, helping other composers realize the
electronic aspects of their compositions. He engineered the live-electronic
setups for Stefan Prins' widely-performed [Generation Kill][genkill] and [Piano
Hero II][ph2], integrating video game controllers and live video capture with
instrumental performers. He also engineered setups for Sabrina Schroeder's
[bass-shaker explorations][shakers], and Timothy McCormacks's tumultuous
[Interfacing with the surface][surface].

His music has been played in the US, Germany and Israel. Berlin's Ensemble
Kaleidosop commissioned Aurora, a 22-voice string orchestra piece for a
festival commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death of Iannis Xenakis. It
was premiered in Berlin's Kammermusiksaal in August of 2011.

He is currently pursuing a doctorate in composition at Harvard University,
where he has studied with Hans Tutschku, Chaya Czernowin and Steven Kazuo
Takasugi. Czernowin. He has also attended the Summer Akademy at Schloss
Solitude in Stuttgart, and previously completed a Bachelors of Music at Oberlin
Conservatory in 2006, where he studied with Lewis Nielson and Randolph Coleman.
