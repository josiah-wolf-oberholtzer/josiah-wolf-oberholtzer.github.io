In 1618, **Sir Walter Raleigh**, chief executive of the ill-fated Virginia Colony
on Roanoke Island, was beheaded for treason against the crown of England.
Legendarily, upon being permitted to examine the executioner's axe, he
remarked,

> "This is a sharp Medicine, but it is a Physician for all diseases and
> miseries."

**Raleigh**, like many creative aristocrats of the time, originated a number of
medicinal cordials, including *Sir Walter Raleigh's Great Cordial* and *Sir
Walter Raleigh's Tobacco Water*.  His *Great Cordial* involves over 30
ingredients: borage, elderflowers, marjoram, cardamom, juniper berries, coral,
crushed pearls, pulverized deer's horn, musk,  ambergris.

Another recipe, recorded some three decades after **Raleigh**'s death in **John
French**'s *The Art of Distillation*, is *aqua magnanimitatis*: the water of
magnanimity.  French describes the procedure thus:

> Take of ants or pismires a handful, of their eggs two hundred, of millepedes
> or woodlice one hundred, and of bees one hundred and fifty. Digest all these
> in two pints of spirit of wine, being very well impregnated with the
> brightest soot. Digest them together the space of a month, then pour off the
> clear spirit and keep it safe.

It was said to improve deafness.
