**Aurora** is the compositional grandchild of an earlier piece, **Mbrsi**,
whose title derives from the Japanese *maboroshi*, meaning *chimera*,
*illusion* or *mirage*.

While this new work trades away the older's graphic score for more traditional
notation, it preserves the original creative nucleus: an experimental,
procedurally-unfolding sonic landscape of color and gesture. Unlike its
predecessors, the new framework allows for the superpositioning of textural
blocks, each with its own ensemble sub-set and internal evolution.

**Aurora** was commissioned and performed by **Ensemble Kaleidoskop** as part
of a festival commemorating the 11th anniversary of the death of **Iannis
Xenakis**.
