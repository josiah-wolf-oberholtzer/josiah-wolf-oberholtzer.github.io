**Italo Calvino**, *Invisible Cities*:

> In vain, great-hearted Kublai, shall I attempt to describe Zaira, city of
> high bastions. I could tell you how many steps make up the streets rising
> like stairways, and the degree of the arcades' curves, and what kind of
> zinc scales cover the roofs; but I already know this would be the same as
> telling you nothing. The city does not consist of this, but of
> relationships between the measurements of its space and the events of its
> past: the height of a lamppost and the distance from the ground of a hanged
> usurper's swaying feet; the line strung from the lamppost to the railing
> opposite and the festoons that decorate the course of the queen's nuptial
> procession; the height of that railing and the leap of the adulterer who
> climbed over it at dawn; the tilt of a guttering and a cat's progress along
> it as he slips into the same window; the firing range of a gunboat which
> has suddenly appeared beyond the cape and the bomb that destroys the
> guttering; the rips in the fish net and the three old men seated on the
> dock mending nets and telling each other for the hundredth time the story
> of the gunboat of the usurper, who some say was the queen's illegitimate
> son, abandoned in his swaddling clothes there on the dock.
>
> As this wave from memories flows in, the city soaks it up like a sponge
> and expands. A description of Zaira as it is today should contain all of
> Zaira's past. The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it
> like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the
> gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the
> lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with
> scratches, indentations, scrolls.
