**Italo Calvino**, *Invisible Cities*:
 
> In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's life, the
> inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or
> gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of
> blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that
> you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are
> dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.

> From a mountainside, camping with their household goods, Ersilia's
> refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that rise in the
> plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing.

> They rebuild Ersilia elsewhere. They weave a similar pattern of strings which
> they would like to be more complex and at the same time more regular than the
> other. Then they abandon it and take themselves and their houses still
> farther away.

> Thus, when traveling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the
> ruins of abandoned cities, without the walls which do not last, without the
> bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spiderwebs of intricate
> relationships seeking a form.

**Ursula Le Guin**, *The Farthest Shore*:

> "Are we still in the South Reach?"

> "Reach? No. The islands --" The chief moved his slender black hand in an arc,
> no more than a quarter of the compass, north to east. "The islands are
> there," he said. "All the islands." Then showing all the evening sea before
> them, from north through west to south, he said, "The sea."

> "What land are you from, lord?"

> "No land. We are the Children of the Open Sea."

> Arren looked at his keen face. He looked about him at the great raft with its
> temple and its tall idols, each carved from a single tree, great god-figures
> mixed of dolphin, fish, man, and seabird; at the people busy at their work,
> weaving, carving, fishing, cooking on raised platforms, tending babies; at
> the other rafts, seventy at least, scattered out over the water in a great
> circle perhaps a mile across. It was a town: smoke rising in thin wisps from
> distant houses, the voices of children high on the wind. It was a town, and
> under its floors was the abyss.
