**John French**, in his *Art of Distillation* (1651), describes one recipe for plague
water like this:

> Take three pints of muscadine and boil in it sage and rue, of each a handful,
> until a pint be wasted. Then strain it and set it over the fire again. Put
> thereto a dram of long pepper, ginger, and nutmeg, of each half an ounce,
> being all bruised together. Then boil them a little and put thereto half an
> ounce of andromachus-treakle, and three drams of mithridate, and a quarter of
> a pint of the best angelica water.
>
> This water (which, as says the author, must be kept as your life, and above
> all earthly treasure) must be taken to the quantity of a spoonful or two
> morning and evening, if you be already infected, and sweat thereupon. If you
> be not infected, a spoonful is sufficient, half in the morning and half at
> night. All the plague time under God (says the author) trust to this, for
> there was never man, woman, or child that failed of their expectation in
> taking it. This is also of the same efficacy, not only against the plague,
> but pox, measles, surfeits, etc.
