From the preface to the score:

> **Mbrsi** is a document from which scores are drawn - a repository of
> material which describes a constellation of related realizations.
>
> Formally, **Mbrsi** contains twelve parallel streams of granularized
> tablature, to be executed by some combination of one or more string players.
> The tablature treats all string instruments as functionally equivalent and
> interchangeable (meanwhile, the realities of idiom manifest as unique
> deformations on the local performance level).
>
> During **Mbrsi**'s development, this ambiguity of ensemble precipitated a
> despecification of many other aspects of the work - first pitch, registration
> and tuning, later temp, duration and structure itself - out of a desire to
> approach something like a "logical conclusion".
>
> The increasingly ambiguous surface nature of the work acted like a
> metaphorical hat-tip to the formal probabilities underlying its construction.
> That underlying material was generated from a sort of "stochastic fabric": a
> collection of two-dimensional noise functions, moving through time (data as
> video), each sliced into twelve "parallel" probability tables, such that
> adjacent tablature streams possess similarly weighted distributions of
> activity along each of their formalized parameters.
>
> Developing a performance then is an act of pulling a (relatively) fixed
> realization from a cloud of possible musics. The organizing party builds a
> score from a fragment or group of fragments, to suit the intended ensemble,
> duration and setting. Longer, uninterrupted swaths, with larger ensembles
> will render more obviously processual sound masses, while smaller and more
> deliberately edited versions will expose the fractured, erratic counterpoint
> of a sparse grain cloud.
>
> A full performance could be drawn out of only a single sheet, as a small
> ensemble piece in miniature, as a solo cutting between parallel streams, or
> by extending material through collage - literally cutting and pasting
> together a new larger score.

The title, **Mbrsi**, is a contraction of the Japanese *maboroshi*, which means
*chimera*, *mirage*, or *illusion*. I was inspired by **Hirokazu Koreeda**'s
film **Maboroshi no hikari** ("illusion of light"). I nearly gave up writing
music entirely while working on this piece and, to this day, I've never
finished writing the full score.
