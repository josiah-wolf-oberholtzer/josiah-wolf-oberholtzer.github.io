**Italo Calvino**, *Invisible Cities*:
 
> Whether Armilla is like this because it is unfinished or because it has been
> demolished, whether the cause is some enchantment or only a whim, I do not
> know. The fact remains that it has no walls, no ceilings, no floors: it has
> nothing that makes it seem a city except the water pipes that rise vertically
> where the houses should be and spread out horizontally where the floors
> should be: a forest of pipes that end in taps, showers, spouts, overflows.
> Against the sky a lavabo's white stands out, or a bathtub, or some other
> porcelain, like late fruit still hanging from the boughs. You would think
> that the plumbers had finished their job and gone away before the bricklayers
> arrived; or else their hydraulic systems, indestructible, had survived a
> catastrophe, an earthquake, or the corrosion of termites.
> 
> Abandoned before or after it was inhabited, Armilla cannot be called
> deserted. At any hour, raising your eyes among the pipes, you are likely to
> glimpse a young woman, or many young women, slender, not tall of stature,
> luxuriating in the bathtubs or arching their backs under the showers
> suspended in the void, washing or drying or perfuming themselves, or combing
> their long hair at a mirror. In the sun, the threads of water fanning from
> the showers glisten, the jets of the taps, the spurts, the splashes, the
> sponges' suds.
>
> I have come to this explanation: the streams of water channeled in the pipes
> of Armilla have remained in the posession of nymphs and naiads. Accustomed to
> traveling along underground veins, they found it easy to enter the new
> aquatic realm, to burst from multiple fountains, to find new mirrors, new
> games, new ways of enjoying the water. Their invasion may have driven out the
> human beings, or Armilla may have been built by humans as a votive offering
> to win the favor of the nymphs, offended at the misuse of the waters. In any
> case, now they seem content, these maidens: in the morning you hear them
> singing.

**Ursula Le Guin**, *The Farthest Shore*:

> The dunes ran inland, low and grassy, for half a mile or so, and then there
> were lagoons, thick with sedge and saltreeds, and beyond those, low hills lay
> yellow-brown and empty out of sight. Beautiful and desolate was Selidor.
> Nowhere on it was there any mark of man, his work or habitation. There were
> no beasts to be seen, and the reed-filled lakes bore no flocks of gulls or
> wild geese or any bird.
