Supriya is a Python interface to SuperCollider.

Supriya lets you:

- boot and communicate with SuperColliderâ€™s scsynth synthesis server
- construct and compile SynthDef unit generator graphs in native Python code
- build and control graphs of synthesizers and synthesizer groups
- object-model scysnth OSC communications explicitly via Request and Response
  classes
- schedule synthesizer events and patterns
