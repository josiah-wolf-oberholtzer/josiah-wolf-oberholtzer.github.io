His research interests range over live electronics, algorithmic composition,
music-informatics and audio analysis. He is one of the lead architects of
[Abjad][abjad], a Python API for formalized score control. Abjad provides a
powerful object-oriented interface to the [LilyPond][lilypond] music
typesetting engine, has facilitated all of his acoustic compositions since
2009, and is used by composers world-wide.

He also works as a sound designer, helping other composers realize the
electronic aspects of their compositions. He has collaborated extensively with
[Sabrina Schroeder][schroeder] on her *Stircrazer* series, which combines
traditional instruments like pianos and bass drums with massive bass-shaker
transducers to create hypnotizing heavy drones. He also engineered the
live-electronic setups for [Stefan Prins][prins]' widely-performed [*Generation
Kill*][genkill] and [*Piano Hero II*][ph2], integrating video game controllers
and live video capture with instrumental performers.

In 2015, he received a doctorate in music composition from Harvard University,
where he studied with Hans Tutschku and Chaya Czernowin. He has also attended
the Summer Akademy at Schloss Solitude in Stuttgart, and previously completed a
Bachelors of Music at Oberlin Conservatory in 2006, where he studied with Lewis
