**Josiah Wolf Oberholtzer** is a composer and researcher, born in Boston in
1984.

> [In *Zaira* (2014), Josiah Wolf Oberholtzer placed two identifiable sounding
> objects in his healthier world of rummaging and rooting: a bang-bang-bang
> pulsation and a tremolo piano harmony, the only real echoes of what most of
> us know as music. With the aid of a conductor mapping out beats and gestures
> we were given some sense of where we humans have been.][review]

His music has been played in the US, Germany and Israel. Recent works include
[*Plague Water*][pw], a quartet for Ensemble Nikel, and the Calvino-inspired
*Invisible Cities* series: [*Invisible Cities (i): Zaira*][zaira], an octet for
Ensemble Mosaik, the viola duet [*Invisible Cities (ii): Armilla*][armilla] for
Elizabeth Weisser and John Pickford Richards, and [*Invisible Cities (iii):
Ersilia*][ersilia], for chamber orchestra, written for Ensemble Dal Niente, In
2011, Ensemble Kaleidosop commissioned [*Aurora*][aurora], a 22-voice string
orchestra piece for a festival commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death
of Iannis Xenakis. He has also composed numerous large-scale multi-channel
works for Harvard University's [HYDRA][hydra] 40-channel speaker orchestra.

His research interests range over live electronics, algorithmic composition,
music-informatics and audio analysis. He is one of the lead architects of
[Abjad][abjad], a Python API for formalized score control. Abjad provides a
powerful object-oriented interface to the [LilyPond][lilypond] music
typesetting engine, has facilitated all of his acoustic compositions since
2009, and is used by composers world-wide.

He also works as a sound designer, helping other composers realize the
electronic aspects of their compositions. He has collaborated extensively with
[Sabrina Schroeder][schroeder] on her *Stircrazer* series, which combines
traditional instruments like pianos and bass drums with massive bass-shaker
transducers to create hypnotizing heavy drones. He also engineered the
live-electronic setups for [Stefan Prins][prins]' widely-performed [*Generation
Kill*][genkill] and [*Piano Hero II*][ph2], integrating video game controllers
and live video capture with instrumental performers.

In 2015, he received a doctorate in music composition from Harvard University,
where he studied with Hans Tutschku and Chaya Czernowin. He has also attended
the Summer Akademy at Schloss Solitude in Stuttgart, and previously completed a
Bachelors of Music at Oberlin Conservatory in 2006, where he studied with Lewis
Nielson and Randolph Coleman.
