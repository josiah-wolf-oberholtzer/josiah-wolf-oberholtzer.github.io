**Josiah Wolf Oberholtzer** is a composer and researcher, born in Boston in
1984.

His music has been played in the US, Germany and Israel. Recent works include
[*Invisible Cities (i): Zaira*][zaira], an octet for Ensemble Mosaik, and
[*Plague Water*][pw] a quartet for Ensemble Nikel. Ensemble Kaleidosop
commissioned [*Aurora*][aurora], a 22-voice string orchestra piece for a
festival commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death of Iannis Xenakis. It
was premiered in Berlin's Kammermusiksaal in August of 2011. He has also
composed numerous large-scale multi-channel works for Harvard University's
[HYDRA][hydra] 40-channel speaker orchestra.

His research interests range over live electronics, algorithmic composition,
music-informatics and audio analysis. He is one of the lead architects of
[Abjad][abjad], a Python API for formalized score control. Abjad provides a
powerful object-oriented interface to the [LilyPond][lilypond] music
typesetting engine, and has facilitated all of his acoustic compositions since
2009.

He also works as a sound designer, helping other composers realize the
electronic aspects of their compositions. He engineered the live-electronic
setups for [Stefan Prins][prins]' widely-performed [*Generation Kill*][genkill]
and [*Piano Hero II*][ph2], integrating video game controllers and live video
capture with instrumental performers. He also engineered setups for [Sabrina
Schroeder][schroeder]'s [bass-shaker explorations][shakers], and [Timothy
McCormacks][mccormack]'s [*Interfacing with the surface*][surface]. He has
collaborated closely with [Edgar Barroso][barroso] for many years as well.

He is currently completing a doctorate in composition at Harvard University,
where he has studied with Hans Tutschku, Chaya Czernowin and Steven Kazuo
Takasugi. He has also attended the Summer Akademy at Schloss Solitude in
Stuttgart, and previously completed a Bachelors of Music at Oberlin
Conservatory in 2006, where he studied with Lewis Nielson and Randolph Coleman.
